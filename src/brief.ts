/**
 * What every isolated Job is told, on top of its own brief.
 *
 * The worker never merges and never touches the operator's checkout — it commits on the branch it
 * was given and opens a *draft* pull request. A human merges. That is what keeps the Job kind
 * dumb: `succeeded` means the session ended, and whether the work is any good is a judgement made
 * by whoever reads the diff.
 *
 * Stated as a protocol rather than a hope. The two rules a worker could plausibly break — pushing
 * to the default branch, and merging its own work — are named explicitly, because "do not" is
 * cheaper here than discovering it afterwards.
